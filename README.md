# Travel-site-first-project-
This is my travel site, my very first project.  I am still working on it as I learn to code.  I have been focusing on cloud architecture the past several months, so i have not updated this code much since then.  I am currently learning python and javascript, hopefully these will help me complete the site to its fullest potential.
The idea behind the project is to provide a place for any wanting to travel to have a source of information that assists in deciding where to travel to.  Along with the google maps api and google flights link for planning and booking.

I wanted the interface to be inspiring, exciting, and intriguing; while maintaining a sense of simplicity for the end user.
